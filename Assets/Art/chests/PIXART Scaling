Pixart Scaling Algorithm in GIMP

duplicate layer
desaturate layer color
set layer mode to light ~50%
filter edge ... differential 5,0
invert layer color
gaussian blur ~2 on layer
merge visible layers
finaly scale down and reduce colors

Values may vary depending on the amount of necessary downscaling and how sharp/pixelated the result should be.
The idea is that edges are broadened such that their width will cover about one pixel in the low-res version to prevent aliasing effects.
Steps could be repeated for creating several mipmap resolutions.
Would be awesome if somebody would write a plugin for GIMP.
